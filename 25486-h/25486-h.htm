<p><span class="smc">Up</span> amongst the hills, perched like the nest of a bird on
one of the long low ridges, lies the little town of
Bethlehem. It was but a small town at the time this
story begins, and there was nothing about it to make
it at all famous. It lay out of the beaten track, and
any one wanting to visit it must needs climb the long
winding road that led from the plain beneath, through
olive groves and sheepfields, up to the city gate&mdash;a
steep, difficult road, leading nowhere but to the little
town itself.</p>

<p>It was in these fields on the slope of the hills that
David, the shepherd boy of Bethlehem, spent his days
watching his father&#8217;s flocks. That father, whose name
<a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was Jesse, was one of the chief men of the town, and
David was the youngest of all his sons.</p>

<p>There were seven big brothers at home, and it was
no wonder Jesse was proud of his sons. They were tall,
splendid young men, all of them doing men&#8217;s work now,
and taking very little notice of the youngest, who was still
only a small boy, chiefly useful in looking after the sheep.</p>

<p>But though David was but little thought of, no one
could say that he did not do his work well. There was
not a more careful or watchful shepherd on all the hills
around Bethlehem. He knew each one of his sheep,
and never allowed one to stray. He always led them
to the best pasture, and found the coolest and freshest
water for them to drink. Then, too, he was as brave as
a lion, and if any wild beast came lurking round hoping
to snatch a lamb away, David was up at once and would
attack the fiercest beast single-handed. Nothing could
ever do any harm to his flock.</p>

<p>Now it happened that one day while David was, as
usual, out in the fields that a sudden stir of excitement
awoke in the little town of Bethlehem. Men gathered
round the city gate, and with anxious, fearful eyes looked
down the long white road that led up from the plain
below. And yet there seemed nothing there to make
them look so terrified and anxious. Only an old feeble
man was slowly climbing up towards the town. He was
driving a heifer before him, and carrying what looked
like a horn in his hand.</p>

<p class="illus"><a name="png.007" id="png.007"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus-07.png" width="500" height="413"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />An old feeble man was slowly climbing up towards the town.</p>

<p>But the people whispered together that the old man
was none other than Samuel, the prophet of the Lord,
who carried God&#8217;s messages. He must be bringing a
message to them, and who knew if it was good or evil.
They tried with uneasy minds to remember if they had
been doing anything wrong of late as they watched the
old man drawing nearer and nearer. Then at last the
chief men of the town went out to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comest thou peaceably?&rdquo; they asked anxiously.</p>

<p>The old man lifted his head and looked at them
kindly as he echoed their words.</p>

<p><a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Peaceably,&rdquo; he answered at once; &ldquo;I am come to
sacrifice unto the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great sigh of relief went up from the people. The
visit was a mark of God&#8217;s favour and not of His displeasure.</p>

<p>It was true, indeed, that Samuel had come to offer
sacrifice, but he had come also on a secret errand about
which no man knew but himself. God had bidden him
take his horn of oil and anoint one of the sons of Jesse
to be king over His people instead of Saul, the present
king, who had displeased Him. But it was to be done
secretly. Saul must not hear of it, or his vengeance
would be swift.</p>

<p>It was in Jesse&#8217;s house that the feast of the sacrifice
was prepared, and Samuel ordered that all the sons of
the house should pass before him as they went to attend
the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The first to come was Eliab, Jesse&#8217;s eldest son, and
when Samuel saw him he felt sure that this was the man
who was to be anointed king. He was a splendid young
man, tall and strong and handsome, looking almost as
kingly as Saul himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely this is he,&rdquo; murmured Samuel to himself.
But God&#8217;s answer came quickly. No, this was not the
man. Samuel saw only the outward signs of strength
and beauty, but God saw deeper into the heart.</p>

<p>So the eldest son passed on, and one by one the six
brothers followed, all sons that a father might well be
<a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>proud of. But God sent no sign to show that any of
them was the chosen king.</p>

<p class="illus"><img src="images/illus-09.png" width="501" height="524"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />&ldquo;Surely this is he,&rdquo; murmured Samuel to himself.</p>

<p>Samuel was puzzled. What could it mean? Then
he turned again to Jesse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are here all thy children?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Surprised at the question, Jesse suddenly remembered
<a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the little lad, his youngest son, who was out in the fields
tending the sheep. Was it possible that Samuel had
any use for him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send and fetch him,&rdquo; ordered Samuel instantly,
&ldquo;for we will not sit down till he comes hither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So a messenger was sent in haste to bring David;
and presently he came hurrying in, and as soon as
Samuel saw him he knew his search was ended.</p>

<p>He was only a little shepherd lad with the breath of
the hills about him, his golden hair tossed by the wind,
his fair face flushed, and his sunburned hand holding
his shepherd&#8217;s crook. But there was no doubt that
God had chosen him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arise and anoint him, for this is he,&rdquo; said God&#8217;s
voice in Samuel&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>Slowly, then, the old man rose and held the oil aloft
and poured it upon the boy&#8217;s bowed head, while the rest
of the company looked silently on.</p>

<p>They were puzzled to know what it all meant.
Perhaps the elder brothers were envious, and wondered
why this mere child should be singled out for special
favour. But no one dared to question God&#8217;s messenger.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Nothing further happened just then. Samuel returned
as he had come by the winding white road, and
before long his visit was forgotten as the people settled
to their work again.</p>

<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="493" height="700"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />Saul tries to kill David</p>

<p>Only David, out in the fields, thought more and
more about what had happened, and grew more and
<a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>more certain that it had been a call from God to do some
special work for Him. The wonder of it filled his mind,
but it never interfered with his work.</p>

<p>There was little time for idle dreaming in the boy&#8217;s
life. He was as watchful as ever in his care for his
sheep and as courageous as ever in guarding them
from prowling beasts. Even in his leisure time he
was busy too, and there was not one of the sunny hours
of daylight that he wasted.</p>

<p>He loved music, and he taught himself to play on
the harp, practising so carefully and patiently that his
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>fingers grew most wonderfully skilful. Then he made
songs to go to the music, some of the most beautiful
songs that ever have been made in all the world.
Almost every child to-day knows his beautiful song about
the Good Shepherd: &ldquo;The Lord is my shepherd, I
shall not want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another thing, too, that he learned to do
with the same care and patient perseverance, and that
was to use his shepherd&#8217;s sling. There was no boy in
all Bethlehem who could shoot as straight as he could.
He never missed his mark.</p>

<p>It was no great thing, perhaps, to make music and
aim straight, but it was a great thing to do what lay
nearest his hand with all his might. Perhaps some day
God would make use of his singing or have some work
for a boy who had a quick eye and a sure aim. Who
could tell?</p>

<p>So David learned to do his very best, and before
very long God&#8217;s call came to him.</p>

<p class="illus"><img src="images/illus-13.png" width="503" height="421"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />Saul sat day after day in his darkened tent.</p>

<p>Saul, the King of Israel, sat day after day in his
darkened tent ill and full of misery. No one dared
to go near him, and his servants whispered together,
&ldquo;It is an evil spirit from the Lord that troubles him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then some one suggested that perhaps music might
help to cheer him and drive the evil spirit from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let our lord now command thy servants to seek
out a man who is a cunning player on a harp,&rdquo; they said
to the king, &ldquo;and it shall come to pass that, when the
<a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>evil spirit from God is upon thee, he shall play with his
hand, and thou shalt be well.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="illus"><img src="images/illus-15.png" width="503" height="446"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />David drew magic music from his harp&#8217;s strings.</p>

<p>Saul listened to their words, and hope crept into
his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Provide me now a man that can play well, and
bring him unto me,&rdquo; he said eagerly.</p>

<p>Now the fame of David&#8217;s playing and singing had
spread even beyond Bethlehem. &ldquo;We must send for
David, the son of Jesse,&rdquo; said the king&#8217;s servants at
once. He was the very person they wanted. Not
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>only could he sing and play, but he was a good boy,
brave and fearless, and best of all, as the servants said,
&ldquo;The Lord is with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the shepherd boy was brought to the king&#8217;s darkened
tent, ready to do his bidding. Sitting there in the
dim light, he drew such magic music from his harp&#8217;s
strings, and sang such sweet songs, that the very song of
the birds seemed to be filling the tent. The king, as
he listened, seemed to feel the breath of the mountain
fields, to hear the call of the sheepfold and the murmur
of the dancing streams. It acted like a charm.
The black misery was lifted from his heart, and the evil
spirit was put to flight by the song of the shepherd
boy.</p>

<p>It was no wonder, then, that the king, for a time
at least, loved the boy with his bright face and sunny
hair, and wanted to keep him as his armour-bearer. But
perhaps, as Saul grew well and had no further need of
the music, David was no longer wanted, and so he went
back again to the Bethlehem fields to look after his
sheep.</p>

<p>God had made use of David&#8217;s skill in music, and before
very long another call came to him. This time the need
was for one who could aim straight, who had a quick eye
and a steady hand.</p>

<p>War had broken out. The fierce Philistines had
come up with their great armies to try and conquer the
land. Every man in Israel who could fight was called
<a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>up to protect his country. Already David&#8217;s three elder
brothers had joined Saul&#8217;s army, which was preparing to
fight the enemy.</p>

<p class="illus"><img src="images/illus-17.png" width="504" height="535"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />Jesse sends David to the camp.</p>

<p>On either side of a narrow valley, divided by a
stream which ran along over smooth stones, the two
armies faced each other. There they were encamped,
<a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>like wild beasts ready to fly at each other&#8217;s throats. At
any moment the fight might begin, and that stream be
stained red with blood. Only the Philistines were far
the strongest, and the Israelites had but little chance of
victory.</p>

<p>This valley was seven or eight miles distant from the
little town of Bethlehem, and Jesse waited anxiously,
day after day, for news of his three sons. At last he
could bear the anxiety no longer, and he determined to
send David to the camp to carry food to his brothers
and bring back news how they fared.</p>

<p>So, very early one morning, David set out on his
errand. He had carefully put his sheep under the care
of another shepherd, and he took with him parched corn
and loaves of bread for his brothers, as well as ten
cheeses which his father was sending to the officers
under whom they served.</p>

<p>It was not long before the boy came within sight
of the valley, and his heart began to beat with excitement,
for he saw that he had arrived just as something
was about to happen. The armies were drawn up in
battle array, and suddenly a great shout went up from
both sides. It was the battle-cry of the two armies
which sounded in his ears.</p>

<p>There was no time now to carry food and gifts, so
David quickly left his load at the entrance to the camp
and hurried on to search for his brothers. He had
learned to find his way about a camp, where for a short
<a name="png.019" id="png.019"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>time he had been Saul&#8217;s armour-bearer. So now he
went swiftly among the soldiers, until at last he found
his brothers. &ldquo;Were they well?&rdquo; he eagerly asked
them; &ldquo;and what were they doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="illus"><img src="images/illus-19.png" width="497" height="449"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />Eagerly David began to ask them what it meant.</p>

<p>But even while he spoke there was a stir among the
Philistines, and all eyes were turned to watch, all ears
were strained to hear the enemy&#8217;s challenge, which rang
out clearly across the narrow valley.</p>

<p>Out of the rank of the Philistines there had stepped
a man so tall and strong that he appeared to be a giant.
<a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">20</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>He was more than nine feet high, and the armour which
he wore was so solid and heavy that it would have
crushed any ordinary man to the earth.</p>

<p>This was Goliath, the great champion of the Philistines.
Every morning and every evening he strode
proudly out and defied the Israelites, bidding them find
a champion who would come and fight with him. Once
again his challenge rang out on the clear <span class="nw">air,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Choose you a man for you, and let him come down
to me. If he be able to fight with me and to kill me,
then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against
him and kill him, then shall ye be our servants and
serve us. I defy the armies of Israel this day. Give
me a man that we may fight together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great silence fell after the champion had shouted
his last words of defiance. There was no answer from
the Israelites. No man had courage enough to dream
of accepting the challenge.</p>

<p>David looked round him in amazement, and his
cheeks burned with shame. What were the people
doing to allow this boasting heathen Philistine to defy
the armies of the living God? Eagerly he turned to the
men around him and began to ask them what it meant.
The soldiers answered him shortly. No, there was no
one who dared to go forth and fight Goliath. The king
had promised great rewards to any man who would kill
the giant. But no one had dared to try.</p>

<p>David&#8217;s elder brothers heard his questions, and seeing
<a name="png.021" id="png.021"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>how amazed he was, they began to grow angry. Did he
mean to reproach them? Perhaps he thought of offering
himself to fight the champion. It was time that
this shepherd boy should be put in his proper place.
So his eldest brother turned to him with a sneer.</p>

<p class="illus"><img src="images/illus-21.png" width="504" height="431"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />While he kept his father&#8217;s sheep he had often to defend
them from wild beasts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why camest thou hither?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;And with
whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?
I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart, for
thou hast come down that thou mightest see the battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It could not have been very easy to bear this taunt.
<a name="png.022" id="png.022"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>But David had learned to conquer himself before he set
out to conquer giants. So he answered quietly instead
of flashing back an angry reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;May I not ask
a harmless question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were many questions he still wished to ask,
and presently the soldiers began to repeat his words one
to another, until at last the report was spread that some
one had been found ready and willing to answer the
challenge of the giant Philistine. And of course the
news soon reached the king&#8217;s ear. Saul sent immediately
and ordered that the shepherd lad should be brought
to him. He had quite forgotten about the boy who
had charmed away his black moods with the magic
music of his harp. And David had grown and changed
since those days.</p>

<p>So now, when David stood before the king, Saul had
no idea who he was, and his one thought, as he looked
at the slender youth, was that it was madness to think
of such a mere boy going out to give battle to the great
giant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art not able to go against this Philistine,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war
from his youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But David answered eagerly. He did not boast,
but spoke steadily and wisely. True, he had not been
trained as a soldier, but his courage and his strength
had both been already proved. And he went on to
<a name="png.023" id="png.023"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">23</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>tell the king that while he kept his father&#8217;s sheep he
had often to defend them from wild beasts. Once he
had fought with a lion and a bear single-handed and had
killed them both.</p>

 />Saul puts his own armour on David.</p>

<p>It was not in his own strength that he trusted. &ldquo;The
Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and
out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of
the hand of this Philistine,&rdquo; he ended triumphantly.</p>

<p><a name="png.024" id="png.024"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Faith in God was David&#8217;s sure defence; and Saul as
he listened bowed his head in shame, for it was the faith
which he himself had lost. It was this faith, he knew,
which might win the victory. It was an echo of the
confidence he had once felt when his whole trust had
been in God, and he recognized the true ring of the
boy&#8217;s courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the Lord be with thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the king was eager to put his own armour
on David, and he bade the soldiers arm him with the
royal sword and put a brass helmet on his head. But
David was not accustomed to wear heavy armour, and
had never been trained to use a sword. No, he
would do his best with the only weapon he thoroughly
understood.</p>

<p>So putting on once more his shepherd&#8217;s coat, he took
his sling in his hand, and as he crossed the brook at the
foot of the valley he filled his shepherd&#8217;s bag with smooth
stones and fitted one of them to his sling. Then with
springing steps he began to climb the opposite side.</p>

<p>The rage of Goliath was great when he saw the
slender, fair-haired boy, without either armour or sword,
coming so boldly to meet him.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Am I a dog,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;that thou comest to me
with staves?&rdquo;</p>

 />David&#8217;s fight with Goliath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts,
the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied,&rdquo;
rang out the clear answer. &ldquo;The Lord saveth not with
<a name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord&#8217;s, and He
will give you into our hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great giant lifted his spear, ready with one blow
to end this unequal fight. But David did not wait to
come within reach of the spear. Before Goliath came
near, the boy stopped suddenly and sent a stone whizzing
through the air straight at the giant&#8217;s head. The stone
sank into Goliath&#8217;s forehead, and the great figure reeled
and fell with a mighty crash to the earth.  Instantly
David seized his sword and cut off his head.</p>

<p>So God&#8217;s people were saved, and so again God made
<a name="png.028" id="png.028"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>use of the shepherd boy&#8217;s training and skill, this time to
win a great victory for His people.</p>

<p>The fair-haired shepherd boy had done his duty
faithfully in the fields on the hillside at home, where he
was but little thought of. He had always tried to do
his best, whether he was keeping the sheep or practising
with his sling or learning to play the harp. And now,
suddenly, the great opportunity had come and found
him ready.</p>

<p>He had entered the camp an unnoticed country lad,
carrying provisions to his brothers. Now every soldier
in the camp was shouting his name; the king was ready
to shower rewards and honors upon him. He was the
hero of the hour.</p>

<p>The pleasant days in the Bethlehem fields were now
over for David. There was no thought of allowing
him to return to his work. No, the king declared he
must remain as a soldier in the army, ready to defend his
king and country. Though he was still a mere boy he
was placed in command and set over the men of war.</p>

<p>It was much more difficult work than looking after
sheep, and as time went on and dangers and difficulties
beset him on every side, David must often have longed
for the old quiet days on the hillside. His path was
rough and dangerous now, and sad to say his feet often
slipped and he wandered far astray, but always he held
fast to his faith in God, and found his way back to the
straight path.</p>

<p><a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>As the years went by Samuel&#8217;s promise was at last
fulfilled, and David was made king over God&#8217;s chosen
people. David had often forgotten God, but God had
never forgotten him.</p>

<p>What a change it was from the days when he
wandered about the fields in his sheepskin coat, often
sleeping out under the stars, possessing only his harp
and his shepherd&#8217;s sling.</p>

<p>Now he wore royal robes, and there was a crown
of pure gold upon his head. Instead of the starry sky
for a roof, he now lived in a palace of cedar wood.</p>

<p>And he knew surely that it was God who had taken
care of him; that it was God who had set the crown of
gold upon his head, the seal to the promise made in that
long ago day when the old prophet had poured the
anointing oil upon the head of the wandering shepherd
boy.</p>

<p>Looking back, he saw that he had made many mistakes,
that his soul was stained with many sins; but he
knew, too, that God would listen when he prayed,
&ldquo;Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a little shepherd lad he had cared far more for
his sheep than his own safety. He had always been
ready to risk his life for them. So now, when he became
king, his people were just as precious to him as
his sheep had been. He cared for them with all his
heart. He was prepared to suffer himself rather than
any hurt should come near them.</p>

<p><a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[folio </span><span
 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>So perhaps he was, after all, not unworthy to stand
as a type of the great King, &ldquo;great David&#8217;s greater
Son,&rdquo; the little Baby who was to be born in the town
of Bethlehem, the Good Shepherd who was to lay
down His life for His sheep.</p>
